      # on ring (MSRV 'stable') and is exempt from our MSRV policy. Instead,
      # enable all other dependencies on the ruma crate and try building that
      # (usually you would enable the higher-level features, but we're only
      # doing this to have all relevant crates compiled, no to build a useful
      # crate).
